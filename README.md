This is my attempt at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)'s problems, one a day.

My friend [Ian Grabill](https://github.com/igrabes) said it best. He coined the term 'Project Euler Bootcamp.'

Also checkout [Blake Johnson](https://github.com/blake41)'s Project
Euler [repo](https://github.com/blake41/eulers).

My account on [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is raywu. Please help me improve my codes!
